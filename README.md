# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS_2
This script prepares the environment and imports libraries for sentiment analysis, likely focusing on sarcasm detection in text data.

Kaggle Docker Image and Input Data

Comments at the beginning explain that the code is running in a Kaggle Docker container pre-configured with helpful libraries for data analysis (referencing the kaggle/python Docker image on GitHub).
It mentions several commonly used libraries like NumPy and Pandas, but they are not explicitly imported in this code block.
Exploring Available Input Data

The code utilizes os.walk to traverse the read-only directory /kaggle/input where Kaggle competitions provide datasets.
The loop iterates through subdirectories, files, and prints the full path of each file within the input directory. This helps users identify the available data for their analysis.
Output and Temporary Files

Comments explain that the current working directory (/kaggle/working/) can store up to 20GB of data that persists when creating a version on Kaggle. This is suitable for output files.
Temporary files can be written to /kaggle/temp/ but won't be saved beyond the current session.
Installing Additional Library

The script uses get_ipython().system('pip install chart_studio') to install the chart_studio library within the notebook environment. This library is likely used for creating interactive visualizations using Plotly.
Library Imports

Finally, the code explicitly imports necessary libraries:
numpy for numerical operations.
chart_studio.plotly as py: This imports the Plotly library for creating visualizations with a py alias.
plotly.graph_objects as go: This imports the go module from Plotly's graph_objects for creating graphical objects like charts.
Functions from plotly.offline are imported for managing offline plotting behavior (download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot).
init_notebook_mode(connected=True) initializes Plotly in notebook mode for interactive visualization.
Overall

This script prepares the environment by leveraging the Kaggle Docker image and installs an additional library for visualization. It then imports core libraries for data manipulation (numpy) and visualization (plotly). By exploring the available input data and managing output/temporary files, the script sets the stage for sentiment analysis tasks using techniques like RNNs, Random Forests, and SVMs.
